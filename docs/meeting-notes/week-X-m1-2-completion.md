# Week X: M1.2 Completion

## Achievements
- ✅ Windowed persistence algorithm implemented
- ✅ Dynamic baseline calibration validated
- ✅ Infection detection confirmed (Day 6.8)
- ✅ Zero false positives in normal healing scenario

## Next Steps
- Proceed to M1.3: Sensitivity analysis
- Generate performance curves for report

## Blocker Resolution
- Resolved noise-induced threshold flickering via windowed approach
- Tuned β to 1.65 for robust margin above 1.0°C threshold
